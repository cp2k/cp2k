How to compile CP2K code
========================

 1) Acquire the code:

    see
        http://cp2k.berlios.de/
    The preferred method is to download it from the CVS
    (just use <Enter> if a password is asked for).

    cd $HOME
    touch $HOME/.cvspass
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cp2k.berlios.de:/cvsroot/cp2k login
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cp2k.berlios.de:/cvsroot/cp2k co cp2k

    If cvs is not installed on your system get it at
        http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/

 2a) GNU make should be on your system (gmake or make on linux) and used for
     the build, go to
         http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html 
     download from
         http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/

 2b) A Fortran 95 compiler should be installed on your system. We have good
     experience with gfortran 4.4.X and 4.5.X.  Be aware that some compilers
     have bugs that might cause them to fail (internal compiler errors,
     segfaults) or, worse, yield a miscompiled CP2K. Report bugs to compiler
     vendors; they (and we) have an interest in fixing them.

 2c) BLAS and LAPACK should be installed.  Using vendor-provided libraries
     can make a very significant difference (up to 100%, e.g., ACML, MKL,
     ESSL).  Note that the BLAS/LAPACK libraries must match the Fortran
     compiler used.  Use the latest versions available and download all patches!
     The canonical BLAS and LAPACK can be obtained from the Netetlib repository.
         http://www.netlib.org/blas/
         http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ and see also
         http://www.netlib.org/lapack-dev/
     A faster alternative is to use the ATLAS project.  It provides BLAS and
     enough of LAPACK to run CP2K, both optimized for the local machine upon
     installation.
         http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
     GotoBLAS is yet a faster BLAS alternative:
         http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/software/ (GotoBLAS)
     If compiling with OpenMP support then it is recommended to use a
     non-threaded version of BLAS.

 2d) MPI (version 2) and SCALAPACK are needed for parallel code.
     (Use the latest versions available and download all patches!)
     If your computing platform does not provide MPI, there are several freely
     available alternatives:
     MPICH2 MPI:  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/
     OpenMPI MPI: http://www.open-mpi.org/
     ScaLAPACK:   http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/ and see also
                  http://www.netlib.org/lapack-dev/
     ScaLAPACK can be part of ACML or cluster MKL.  These libraries are
     recommended if available.  Recently a ScaLAPACK installer has been added
     that makes installingScaLAPACK easier:
         http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/scalapack_installer.tgz

 2e) FFTW can be used to improve FFT speed (depending on architecture).
     It is strongly recommended to install and use FFTW3.  The current version
     of CP2K works with FFTW 2.X or FFTW 3.X (use -D__FFTW2 *or* -D__FFTW3).
         http://www.fftw.org/
     Note that FFTW must know the Fortran compiler you will use in order to
     install properly (e.g., 'export F77=g95' before configure if you intend
     to use g95).
     Note that on machines and compilers which support SSE you can configure
     FFTW3 with --enable-sse2.  Compilers/systems that do not allign memory
     (NAG f95) should either not use '--enable-sse2' or otherwise set the flag
     FFTW_ARRAYS_ALIGNED to false in the CP2K input file. 

 2f) Hartree-Fock exchange (optional, use -D__LIBINT) requires the libint
     package to be installed.  It is easiest to install with a Fortran compiler
     that supports ISO_C_BINDING and Fortran procedure pointers (recent
     gfortran, g95, xlf90, ifort).
     Additional information can be found in
     cp2k/tools/hfx_tools/libint_tools/README_LIBINT
     Tested against libinit-1.1.4 and currently hardcoded to the default
     angular momentum LIBINT_MAX_AM 5
     (check your include/libint/libint.h to see if it matches)
         http://www.chem.vt.edu/chem-dept/valeev/software/libint/libint.html
     Note, do *NOT* use libinit-1.1.3.

 2g) libsmm support (optional):
     * A library for small matrix multiplies can be built from the included
       source (see tools/build_libsmm/README).  Usually only the double
       precision real and perhaps complex is needed.  Link to the generated
       libraries.
     * Add -D__HAS_smm_dnn to the defines to make the code use the double
       precision real library.  Similarly use -D__HAS_smm_snn for single
       precision real and -D__HAS_smm_znn / -D__HAS_smm_cnn for
       double / single precision complex.

 2h) CUDA support (optional, under development):
     * (Experimental): Use the __DBCSR_CUDA to compile with CUDA
       support for matrix multiplication.  For linking add -lcudart and -lrt
       to LIBS.  The compiler must support ISO_C_BINDING.
     * Use __CUDAPW and/or __FFTCU for CUDA support for PW and FFT
       calculations.  The Fortran compiler must use an appended
       underscore for linking C subroutines.
     * Consult cuda_tools/README for more information.


 3) To compile the code:

 3a) The location of compiler and libraries needs to be specified.  Examples
     for a number of common architectures examples can be found in cp2k/arch/*.*
     The names of these files match architecture.version (e.g.,
     Linux-x86-64-g95.sopt).
     Conventionally, there are four versions:
     'sopt' - serial
     'popt' - parallel (only MPI) - recommended for general usage
     'ssmp' - parallel (only OpenMP)
     'psmp' - parallel (MPI + OpenMP)
     You'll need to modify one of these files to match your system's settings.
     You can now build CP2K using these settings (where -j N allows for a
     parallel build using N processes):
     
     > cd cp2k/makefiles
     > make -j N ARCH=architecture VERSION=version
     e.g.
     > make -j N ARCH=Linux-x86-64-g95 VERSION=sopt
     as a short-cut, you can build several version of the code at once
     > make -j N ARCH=Linux-x86-64-g95 sopt popt ssmp psmp

     An executable should appear in cp2k/exe/*

     All compiled files, libraries, executables, .. of all architectures and
     versions can be removed with
     > make distclean
     To remove only objects and mod files (i.e., keep exe) for a given
     ARCH/VERSION use, e.g.,
     > make ARCH=Linux-x86-64-g95 VERSION=sopt clean
     to remove everything for a given ARCH/VERSION use, e.g.,
     > make ARCH=Linux-x86-64-g95 VERSION=sopt realclean

 3b) The following flags should be present (or not) in the arch file
     (see also 3c, next)
     -D__parallel -D__BLACS -D__SCALAPACK: parallel runs
     -D__LIBINT: use libint (needed for HF exchange)
     various FFTs (use __FFTW3 if possible) :
     -D__FFTSG: Stefan Goedecker FFT (should always be there)
     -D__FFTW3: FFTW version 3
     -D__FFTW2: FFTW version 2
     -D__FFTESSL: ESSL
     -D__FFTMKL: mkl
     -D__FFTACML: acml (interface known to be buggy)
     various compilers/architectures needing their own machine_* file
     -D__G95
     -D__NAG
     -D__AIX
     -D__ABSOFT
     -D__PGI
     -D__INTEL
     -D__GFORTRAN
     -D__SX
     -D__DEC
     -D__XT3
     with -D__GRID_CORE=X (with X=1..6) specific optimized core routines can
                             be selected.  Reasonable defaults are provided
                             (see src/lib/collocate_fast.F) but trial-and-error
			     might yield (a small ~10%) speedup.
     Some options controlling MPI behavior and capabilities:
     -D__NO_MPI_THREAD_SUPPORT_CHECK  - Workaround for MPI libraries that do
                             not declare they are thread safe but you want to
                             use them with OpenMP code anyways.
     -D__NO_MPI_MEMORY     - Do not use MPI memory allocation/deallocation
                             routines.
     And others...
     -D__FFTSGL            - Use single precision FFT (unsure of status)

 3c) CP2K currently assumes full Fortran 95 compliance and expects the
     ISO_C_BINDING module of Fortran 2003 to be present, which
     commonly is available even in current compilers.  For OpenMP,
     version 3.0 is assumed.

     If you you get compilation errors about unsupported language
     features, then some flags may be used to reduce the language
     features required.

     In addition, some flags are used to declare compiler support for
     additional language features that the compiler supports.

     Subparts of Fortran 2003 or later that help various aspects of the code:
     -D__PTR_RANK_REMAP    - compiler supports pointer rank remapping
     -D__HAS_NO_ISO_C_BINDING - compiler does not support all needed
                             ISO_C_BINDING features. The default is to
                             assume support.  (At least g95 0.91
                             silently fails with segfaults since it
                             does not support C_F_POINTER.)
     Other language capabilities and support:
     -D__HAS_NO_OMP_3      - CP2K assumes that compilers support OpenMP 3.0.
                             If this is not the case specify this flag to
                             compile.  Runtime performance will be poorer on
                             low numbers of processors
     -D__CRAY_POINTERS     - compiler supports CRAY pointers

 3d) Additional esoteric, development, and debugging options.  This
     section can be safely skipped over.  Listed here just for
     completeness besides the flags described in this document.
     -D__USE_CP2K_TRACE     - The DBCSR library should use CP2K's stack &
                              error tracing.  If enabled, add
                              timings_mp.o to LIBS.
     -D__NO_STATM_ACCESS    - Do not try to read from /proc/self/statm to
                              get memory usage information.  This is
                              otherwise attempted on several
                              Linux-based architectures or using with
                              the NAG, gfortran, and g95 compilers.
     -D__mp_timeset__       - Timing of MPI routines.
     -D__USE_LEGACY_WEIGHTS - Use legacy atomic weights (?)
     -D__NO_ASSUMED_SIZE_NOCOPY_ASSUMPTION - Do not assume that
                              assumed-sized dummy arguments will
                              always be passed in by reference.
                              Unless the ISO_C_BINDINGS is present,
                              CP2K will not compile with this option.
     -D__cray_pointers      - cray pointers will be be used in preference
                              to the ISO_C_BINDINGS call to
                              MPI_ALLOC_MEM.
     -D__SGL                - use single precision as the default real type
                              (abandoned, probably does not work)
     -D__PLASMA             - plasma support for DBCSR (neglected, may not work)
     -D__USE_PAT            - craypat profiling (?)
     -D__HMD                - ?
     -D__HPM                - ?
     

 3e) The `I'm feeling lucky' version of building will try to guess what
     architecture you're on.
     Just type
     > make sopt
     and the script '~/cp2k/tools/get_arch_code' will try to guess your
     architecture.  You can set the 'FORT_C_NAME' to indicate the compiler
     part of the architecture string.
     > export FORT_C_NAME=g95

 4) If things fail, take a break... have a look at section 3c and go back
    to 3a (or skip to step 7).

 5) If your compiler/machine is really special, it shouldn't be too difficult
    to support it.
    Only ~/cp2k/src/machine*.F (and possibly src/dbcsr_lib/machine.F) should
    be affected.

 6) If compilation works fine, you can run one of the test cases 
    to try out the executable (most inputs in any of the cp2k/tests/*regtest*/
    directories are tested on a daily basis).

    >  cd ~/cp2k/tests/QS/
    > ~/cp2k/exe/YOURMACHINE/cp2k.sopt C.inp

    systematic testing can be done following the description on regtesting:
    http://cp2k.berlios.de/regtest.html
