* The structure of the toolchain scripts:

  - install_cp2k_toolchain.sh is the main script that will call all
    other scripts.  It contains default flag settings, user input
    parser, calls to each package installation scripts and the
    generator of the CP2K arch files.

  - script/install_*.sh are the installation scripts for individual
    packages. They are relatively indenpendent, in the sense that by
    running script/install_PKG.sh it should install the package on its
    own. However, in practice due to dependencies to other libraries,
    sometimes for a package to be installed this way, it will depend
    on other libraries being already installed and the correct
    environment varialbles set. At the end of each script, it should
    write to TWO files: build/setup_PKG and install/setup.
    - The build/setup_PKG file contains all the instructions to set
      the variables used by the install_cp2k_toolchain.sh and other
      script/install_PKG.sh scripts in order for them to correctly
      compile the toolchain and set the correct library flags for the
      arch files.
    - The install/setup file contains all the instructions for setting
      up the correct environment before the user can compile and/or
      run CP2K.

  - script/toolkit.sh contains all the macros that may be used by all
    of the scripts, and provides functionalities such as prepending a
    path, checking if a library exists etc.

  - script/common_var.sh contains all of the common variables used by
    each installation scripts. All of the variables in the file should
    have a default value, but allow the environment to set the values,
    using:
                       VAR=${VAR:-default_value}

  - script/parse_if.py is a python code for parsing the IF_XYZ(A|B)
    constructs in the script. Nested structures will be parsed
    correctly. See IF_XYZ constructs below.

  - script/package_versions.sh contains the version of the packages to
    be installed (if they are to be installed).

  - checksums.sha256 contains the precalculated SHA256 checksums for
    the tar balls of all of the packages. This is used by the
    download_pkg macro in script/toolkit.sh

  - arch_base.tmpl contains the template skeleton structure for the
    arch files. The install_cp2k_toolchain script will set all the
    variables used in the template file, and then do an eval to expand
    all of ${VARIABLE} items in arch_base.tmpl to give the cp2k arch
    files.

* The with_PKG and PKG_MODE variables:

  The with_PKG options controls how a package is going to be
  installed: either compiled and installed from source downloaded
  (__INSTALL__), or linked to locations provided by system search
  paths (__SYSTEM__), or linked to locations provided by the user
  (path to some directory), or that the installer won't be used
  (__DONTUSE__).

  For most packages the with_PKG variables will act like a switch for
  turning on or off the support for this package. However, for
  packages serving the same purpose, with the installer needing only
  one, an extra variable PKG_MODE (e.g. MPI_MODE) are used as a
  selector.  In this case, while with_PKG controls the installation
  method, the PKG_MODE variable picks which package to actually use.
  This provides more flexibility.

* The IF_XYZ constructs

  Due to the fact that install_cp2k_toolchain.sh needs to produce
  several different versions of the arch files: popt, psmp, pdbg,
  sopt, ssmp etc, it will have to resolve different flags for
  different arch file versions.

  The solution used by this script is to use a syntax construct:

               IF_XYZ(A | B)

  A parser will then parse this expression to "A" if "XYZ" is passed
  to the parser (python parse_if.py filename XYZ); and to "B" if "XYZ"
  is not passed as command line option (python parse_if.py filename).

  The IF_XYZ(A|B) construct can be nested, so things like:

               IF_XYZ(IF_ABC(flag1|flag2) | flag3)

  will parse to "flag1" if both XYZ and ABC are present in the command
  line arguments of parser_if.py, to "flag2" if only XYZ is present,
  and "flag3" if nothing is present.

* To ensure portability:

  - one should always pass compiler flags through the
    allowed_gcc_flags and allowed_gfortran_flags filters in
    scripts/toolkit.sh to omitt any flags that are not supported by
    the gcc version used (or installed by this script).

  - note that allowed_gcc_flags and allowed_gfortran_flags do not work
    with IF_XYZ constructs. So if you have something like:

    FCFLAGS="IF_XYZ(flag1 flag2 | flag3 flag4)"

    Then you should break this into:

    XYZ_TRUE_FLAGS="flags1 flags2"
    XYZ_FALSE_FLAGS="flags3 flags4"
    # do filtering
    XYZ_TRUE_FLAGS="$(allowed_gcc_flags $XYZ_TRUE_FLAGS)"
    XYZ_FALSE_FLAGS="$(allowed_gcc_flags $XYZ_FALSE_FLAGS)"

    So that:

    FCFLAGS="IF_XYZ($XYZ_TRUE_FLAGS | $XYZ_FALSE_FLAGS)"

  - For any intrinsic fortran modules that may be used, it is best to
    check with check_gfortran_module macro defined in
    script/tool_kit.sh. Depending on the gcc version, some intrinsic
    modules may not exist.

  - Try to avoid as much hard coding as possible:
    e.g. instead of setting:

         ./configure --prefix=some_dir CC=mpicc FC=mpif90

    use the common variables:

         ./configure --prefix=some_dir CC=${MPICC} FC=${MPIFC}

* To keep maintainbility it is recommended that we follow the following practices:

  - Reuse as much functionality from the macros defined in the
    script/toolkit.sh as possible

  - When the exisiting macros in script/toolkit.sh do not provide the
    functionalities you want, it is better to write the new
    functionality as a macro in script/toolkit.sh, and then use the
    macro (repeatedly if required) in the actual installation
    script. This keeps the installation scripts uncluttered and more
    readable.

  - All packages should install into their own directories, and with a
    lock file created in their respective directory to indicate
    installation has been successful. This allows the script to skip
    over the compilation stages of already installed packages if the
    user terminated the toolchain script at the middle of a run and
    then restarted the script.
