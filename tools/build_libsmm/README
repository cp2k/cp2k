libsmm: a library for small matrix multiplies.

in order to deal efficiently with small matrix multiplies,
often involving 'special' matrix dimensions such as 5,13,17,22, 
a dedicated matrix library can be generated that outperforms (or matches)
general purpose (optimized) blas libraries.

Generation requires extensive compilation and timing runs, and is machine specific, 
i.e. the library should be constructed on the architecture it is supposed to run.

Users can modify the values inside the file config.in to set which kind of library
they want to generate. Furthermore, they can modify (or add) the files inside
the config directory to set the compiler options used to build the
library. They can use the existing files as template.

There are several options for building the library. Run ./generate -h to see them.
Below you can find the detailed instructions for some examples.

====================================================================================================================
a) How to generate the library running several jobs in a cluster, where each
   computer allows for both execution and compilation. 
   For this example we will use a CRAY system with GNU compiler and SLURM.
   Run "./generate -h" to see the meaning of the options.

   1) Run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu -j 100 -t 16 -w slurm tiny1
      This command submits 100 jobs in batch. Wait until their completion.

   2) Run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu tiny2
      This command collects all results produced in the tiny1 phase and it
      generates a file tiny_gen_optimal_dnn_cray.gnu.out

   3) As done in 1) and 2), run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu -j 20 -t 16 -w slurm small1
      This command submits 20 jobs in batch. Wait until their completion.
      Then run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu small2
      This command collects all results produced in the small1 phase and it
      generates a file small_gen_optimal_dnn_cray.gnu.out
      
   4) Run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu -t 16 -w slurm lib
      This commman submit in batch a single job that compiles the library.
      At the end the library is produced inside the directory lib/
      (libsmm_dnn_cray.gnu.a). 

   5) It is highly recommended to run the final test to check the correctness of the library.
      Run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu -j 20 -w slurm check1
      After the batch jobs completion, run: ./generate -c config/cray.gnu -j 20 check2
      Note that it is important to use the same number of jobs specified in
      check1 phase. Finally check test_smm_dnn_cray.gnu.out for performance and correctness.

   6) Intermediate files (but not some key output and the library itself)
      might be removed using ./generate clean

b) How to generate the library for the Intel Xeon Phi in batch mode
   For this example we will use a cluster with SLURM, where each node has a MIC card.
   Run "./generate -h" to see the meaning of the options.
   We use the config file mic.intel (inside the directory config).
   Check if all options are OK for your case, in particular:
    - the target_compile variable with the flag -mmic, e.g.:
      target_compile="ifort -O2 -funroll-loops -vec-report2 -warn -mmic -fno-inline-functions -nogen-interfaces -openmp"
    - the variable MICFS to the exported directory between host and Intel Xeon Phi, 
      e.g. MICFS=~/.mic_exported_directory. Note that the directory is created if doesn't exist.
    - the variable MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH where to find the Intel Xeon Phi library on the card
    - the variable ssh_mic_cmd, e.g ssh_mic_cmd="ssh mic0"
    - the variable SINK_LD_LIBRARY_PATH, i.e. where to find the Intel Xeon Phi library on the host
    - the variable mic_cmd, which by default is mic_cmd="/opt/intel/mic/bin/micnativeloadex"
   
   1) Run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel -j 100 -t 40 -w slurm tiny1
      This command submits 100 jobs in batch. Each job offloads executions
      to the MIC card. Wait until completion of all jobs.

   2) Run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel tiny2
      This command collects all results of the tiny1 phase and it generates
      the file tiny_gen_optimal_dnn_mic.intel.out.

   3) As done in 1) and 2), run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel -j 200 -t 10 -w slurm small1
      This command submits 200 jobs in batch, where each job offloads
      executions to the MIC card. Note that the maximum number of threads is 10.
      Wait until their completion. Then run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel small2
      This command collects all results produced in the small1 phase and it
      generates a file small_gen_optimal_dnn_mic.intel.out

   4) Run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel -t 16 -w slurm lib
      This commman submit in batch a single job that compiles the library.
      At the end the library is produced inside the directory lib/
      (libsmm_dnn_mic.intel.a). 

   5) It is highly recommended to run the final test to check the correctness of the library.
      Run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel -j 200 -w slurm check1
      After the batch jobs completion, run: ./generate -c config/mic.intel -j 200 check2
      Note that it is important to use the same number of jobs specified in
      check1 phase. Finally check test_smm_dnn_mic.intel.out for performance and correctness.

   6) Intermediate files (but not some key output and the library itself)
      might be removed using ./generate clean
