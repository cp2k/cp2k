# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file
#      6 looks for the final energy of the MC simulation

# QS MC test for volume moves and the ref_cell on water
MC_QS.inp 6
# binary Ar/water GEMC constant pressure simulation...requires an input
# file for each of the two simulation boxes...constant pressure means each
# box can change volume independently...uses FIST and the biasing potential
# (bias_template.inp, which is also used for canonical_bias.inp)
GEMC_NpT_box1.inp 6
# same as GEMC_NpT_box1.inp, except performs a canonical Gibbs simulation...
# this means the overall volume of the system is constant, so an attempt
# to make one box smaller makes the other box larger...this is the only
# choice for a one component system with the Gibbs ensemble
GEMC_NVT_box1.inp 6
# same as GEMC_NVT_box1.inp, except tests molecule swaps between boxes
# instead of volume moves
GEMC_NVT_box1.inp 6
# KG MC testing AVBMC NpT with KG 
MC_KG.inp 6
# a simple canonical (constant NVT) simulation on the binary water/argon
# system...uses translations, rotations, and bond length/angle changes, 
# but the last one only for water...uses FIST
canonical.inp 6
# same as canonical.inp, but this uses a biasing potential (found in 
# bias_template.inp)...performs a series of moves with the biasing
# potential before correcting with the "real" potential
canonical_bias.inp 6
