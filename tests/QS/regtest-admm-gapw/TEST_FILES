# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# see regtest/TEST_FILES
# These tests are a representative set of the GPW ADMM tests, but run under GAPW. The results differ
# because of the highly non-convreged nature of the calculations (but agree for converged parameters)
