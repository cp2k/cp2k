# Fist EAM Regression Tests

The potentials for Ag, Pt and Au listed here are converted from the [LAMMPS distribution](http://lammps.sandia.gov).
The mixed file is generated by multiplication of Za(R)*Zb(R)/R as prescribed in Foiles et al., PRB 33 (1986) 7983.
Note that the grid is quite loose, so `EMAX_SPLINE` is set to a high value (D. Passerone).
