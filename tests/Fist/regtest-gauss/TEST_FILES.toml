# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file
#      for details see cp2k/tools/do_regtest

# systematic tests of all combations of ions with core-shell atoms
# and also of gaussian ions/shells and point shells. the energy
# obtained with a python script is included in the first line
# of each input
