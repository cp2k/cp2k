# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file

# Sirius will run in serial and parallel with or without cuda

# testing global tree creation using single exact potential, the deterministic random number generator
#   with the standard move types, check i
# fully test non colinear magnetism with spin orbit coupling
