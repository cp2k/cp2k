# directories in this file will be scanned for a TEST_FILES entry, and used in regression testing of cp2k
# additional fields are requirements on the list of cp2kflags provided by cp2k --version, i.e. regtests that will only run if a certain library has been linked in.
# Directories have been reordered according the execution time needed for a gfortran pdbg run using 2 MPI tasks
# in case a new directory is added just add it at the top of the list..
# the order will be regularly checked and modified...
